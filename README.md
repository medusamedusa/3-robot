# 3-robot

This respository contains the code and some examples of application of a quantum gate for a 3-robot toy model.

The content is the following:
- file (code1.qasm): the Qiskit code of the 2-robot circuit
- file (xy_robots_code.qasm): the Qiskit code of the 3-robot circuit
- file (GHZ.qasm): the Qiskit code of the GHZ circuit
- file (code_1_January_2022.ipynb): code Jupyter/Python locally calling IBM QASM Simulator
- file (video_3-robot.m4v): the video simulation of Test1
- zip file (gate_xy_screenshots): the screenshots of our circuit run on QASM Simulator and three different quantum computers (Bogot√†, Lima, Manila)
- zip file (trials_Jan_29): PDF versions of the code in the Ant Lines setup
